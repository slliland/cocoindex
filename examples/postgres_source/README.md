# PostgreSQL Source Example (v1) 🗄️

[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/cocoindex-io/cocoindex?color=5B5BD6)](https://github.com/cocoindex-io/cocoindex)

This example demonstrates how to use a PostgreSQL table as a source for CocoIndex v1. It reads structured product data from an existing table, computes derived fields, generates embeddings, and stores results in another PostgreSQL table.

We appreciate a star ⭐ at [CocoIndex Github](https://github.com/cocoindex-io/cocoindex) if this is helpful.

## Prerequisites

1. Install dependencies:

```sh
pip install -e .
```

2. A running Postgres with the pgvector extension. If you don't have one, start a local instance with the compose file in this repo:

   ```sh
   docker compose -f ../../dev/postgres.yaml up -d
   ```

3. Create source table `source_products` with sample data:

```sh
psql "postgres://cocoindex:cocoindex@localhost/cocoindex" -f ./prepare_source_data.sql
```

For simplicity, we use the same database for source and target. You can also set `SOURCE_DATABASE_URL` to use a separate database.

## Run

Build/update the index (one-shot catch-up; the postgres source does not support live mode):

```sh
cocoindex update main
```

Query:

```sh
python main.py "wireless headphones"
```

## Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the blanks — it is loaded automatically when you run the example:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

Set `POSTGRES_URL` (where results are written) and `SOURCE_DATABASE_URL` (the table read as the source) — they can point at the same instance.
