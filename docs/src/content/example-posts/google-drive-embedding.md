![Semantic Search over Google Drive with CocoIndex V1](https://cocoindex.io/blobs/docs-v1/img/examples/google-drive-embedding/cover.png)

This is the [Semantic Search 101](https://cocoindex.io/docs/examples/text-embedding/) example with exactly one thing swapped: instead of reading Markdown off your local disk, it reads documents straight from a **Google Drive** folder. Everything downstream — chunking, embedding, and storing the vectors in Postgres with pgvector — is identical, so this post spends its prose on the one piece that differs: the Drive connector.

The chunk-and-embed half is explained in full in the [base walkthrough](https://cocoindex.io/docs/examples/text-embedding/); read that first if you want the line-by-line tour. Here we focus on wiring [Google Drive](https://cocoindex.io/docs/connectors/google_drive/) as the source.

## Flow overview

![CocoIndex Google Drive embedding flow: read files from a Drive folder, split into chunks, embed each chunk, and store the vectors in Postgres with pgvector](https://cocoindex.io/blobs/docs-v1/img/examples/google-drive-embedding/flow-v1.png)

From a high level, these are the steps:

1. List documents under one or more Google Drive folders (recursively), exporting Docs/Sheets/Slides to text.
2. [Split each file into overlapping chunks](https://cocoindex.io/docs/ops/text/), then [embed](https://cocoindex.io/docs/ops/sentence_transformers/) every chunk.
3. Store the chunks and their embeddings in Postgres (as [target states](https://cocoindex.io/docs/programming_guide/target_state/)).

You [declare the transformation logic](https://cocoindex.io/docs/programming_guide/core_concepts/) with native Python, without worrying about how updates propagate. Think: **target_state = transformation(source_state)**.

## Connect to Google Drive

The Drive source needs two things: a Google Cloud **service-account JSON key** with Drive access, and the **folder id(s)** to index. CocoIndex reads both from environment variables, so nothing is hardcoded.

```python title="main.py"
from cocoindex.connectors import google_drive, postgres

credential_path = os.environ["GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIAL"]
root_folder_ids = [
    folder.strip()
    for folder in os.environ["GOOGLE_DRIVE_ROOT_FOLDER_IDS"].split(",")
    if folder.strip()
]

source = google_drive.GoogleDriveSource(
    service_account_credential_path=credential_path,
    root_folder_ids=root_folder_ids,
)
```

`GoogleDriveSource` walks each root folder recursively and yields one `DriveFile` per document. Native Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides are exported to text (Markdown, CSV, and plain text respectively); any other file is downloaded as-is. That's the whole connector — from here on, a `DriveFile` behaves like any other [`FileLike`](https://cocoindex.io/docs/connectors/localfs/), so `await file.read_text()` works just as it does for a local file.

## Define the main function

`app_main` mounts the Postgres table, then fans out one [processing component](https://cocoindex.io/docs/programming_guide/processing_component/) per Drive file with `mount_each`. The processing component is the same `process_file` from the base example — read the file, chunk it, embed each chunk, and `declare_row` a `DocEmbedding` per chunk.

```python title="main.py"
@coco.fn
async def app_main() -> None:
    table = await postgres.mount_table_target(
        PG_DB,
        table_name=TABLE_NAME,
        table_schema=await postgres.TableSchema.from_class(
            DocEmbedding,
            primary_key=["id"],
        ),
        pg_schema_name=PG_SCHEMA_NAME,
    )

    source = google_drive.GoogleDriveSource(
        service_account_credential_path=credential_path,
        root_folder_ids=root_folder_ids,
    )

    await coco.mount_each(process_file, source.items(), table)
```

`source.items()` yields `(key, file)` pairs keyed by the file's name path, which is exactly the shape [`mount_each`](https://cocoindex.io/docs/programming_guide/processing_component/) expects — so the engine tracks each Drive file as its own component and updates them independently. `mount_table_target` creates and manages the Postgres table: schema, idempotent upserts, and orphan cleanup when a file disappears from the folder.

## Setup

- A running Postgres with the [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) extension:

  ```sh
  export POSTGRES_URL="postgres://cocoindex:cocoindex@localhost/cocoindex"
  ```

- A Google Cloud **service account** with Drive access, and the folder id(s) you want to index. Share the folders with the service account's email, then:

  ```sh
  export GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CREDENTIAL="/path/to/service-account.json"
  export GOOGLE_DRIVE_ROOT_FOLDER_IDS="folder_id_1,folder_id_2"
  ```

- Install CocoIndex with the Google Drive extra and the dependencies this example uses:

  ```sh
  pip install -U "cocoindex[postgres,sentence_transformers,google_drive]" asyncpg pgvector numpy python-dotenv
  ```

## Run the pipeline

The Google Drive source does a one-shot catch-up (live mode isn't supported), so build the index with a single `cocoindex update`:

```sh
cocoindex update main
```

Then search straight from the command line, reusing the *same* embedder from the indexing flow so indexing and querying stay consistent:

```bash
python main.py "what is self-attention?"
```

The most semantically similar chunks come back ranked — even when they share none of the words in your query.

## Incremental updates

Just like the [base example](https://cocoindex.io/docs/examples/text-embedding/), CocoIndex does the **minimum work** to keep the index in sync. `@coco.fn(memo=True)` on `process_file` skips any Drive file whose content and the function's code are both unchanged, and `mount_table_target` derives each row's [`id`](https://cocoindex.io/docs/common_resources/id_generation/) from its chunk text, so only the rows that actually changed are upserted and rows whose source is gone are deleted.

- **A document is added to the folder** — only that file is chunked and embedded, and its rows are inserted.
- **A document is edited** — it is re-chunked; unchanged chunks keep their `id` and embedding, genuinely new chunks are embedded and inserted, and chunks that no longer exist are deleted.
- **A document is removed from the folder** — its rows are removed from the target automatically.

Because the Drive source is catch-up only, each `cocoindex update main` rescans the folders and applies exactly the difference.

## Run it

The full, runnable example is in the CocoIndex repo: [examples/gdrive_text_embedding](https://github.com/cocoindex-io/cocoindex/tree/main/examples/gdrive_text_embedding). If you haven't yet, read [Semantic Search 101](https://cocoindex.io/docs/examples/text-embedding/) for the line-by-line tour of chunking and embedding.
