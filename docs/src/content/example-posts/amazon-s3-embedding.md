![Embed Markdown from Amazon S3 with CocoIndex V1](https://cocoindex.io/blobs/docs-v1/img/examples/amazon-s3-embedding/cover.png)

This is the [Semantic Search 101](https://cocoindex.io/docs/examples/text-embedding/) example with one thing swapped: the source is an **Amazon S3 bucket** instead of a local directory. Everything downstream — chunking, embedding, the Postgres/pgvector target, and the query — is identical, so this post spends its words on the part that differs: the S3 connector, its env vars, and the catch-up run.

If you haven't read the base example yet, start there — it walks through the chunk-and-embed flow line by line. Here we'll move fast.

## Flow overview

![CocoIndex Amazon S3 embedding flow: list Markdown objects from a bucket, split into chunks, embed each chunk, and store the vectors in Postgres with pgvector](https://cocoindex.io/blobs/docs-v1/img/examples/amazon-s3-embedding/flow-v1.png)

From a high level, these are the steps:

1. List Markdown objects from an [Amazon S3](https://cocoindex.io/docs/connectors/amazon_s3/) bucket (filtered by prefix and glob).
2. [Split each file into overlapping chunks](https://cocoindex.io/docs/ops/text/), then [embed](https://cocoindex.io/docs/ops/sentence_transformers/) every chunk.
3. Store the chunks and their embeddings in Postgres (as [target states](https://cocoindex.io/docs/programming_guide/target_state/)).

You [declare the transformation logic](https://cocoindex.io/docs/programming_guide/core_concepts/) with native Python, without worrying about how updates propagate. Think: **target_state = transformation(source_state)**.

The chunk-and-embed half of this pipeline is unchanged from [Semantic Search 101](https://cocoindex.io/docs/examples/text-embedding/) — same `RecursiveSplitter`, same [`SentenceTransformerEmbedder`](https://cocoindex.io/docs/ops/sentence_transformers/) with `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, same `DocEmbedding` row written to pgvector. The only new piece is the connector.

## Provide an S3 client

The S3 connector needs an [aiobotocore](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiobotocore) client. We open it once in the [lifespan](https://cocoindex.io/docs/programming_guide/context/) alongside the Postgres pool and embedder, and share it through a `ContextKey`.

```python title="main.py"
DATABASE_URL = os.getenv("POSTGRES_URL", "postgres://cocoindex:cocoindex@localhost/cocoindex")
TABLE_NAME = "amazon_s3_doc_embeddings"
S3_BUCKET = os.environ["S3_BUCKET"]
S3_PREFIX = os.getenv("S3_PREFIX", "")

PG_DB = coco.ContextKey[asyncpg.Pool]("s3_embedding_db")
S3_CLIENT = coco.ContextKey[AioBaseClient]("s3_client")
EMBEDDER = coco.ContextKey[SentenceTransformerEmbedder]("embedder", detect_change=True)


@coco.lifespan
async def coco_lifespan(builder: coco.EnvironmentBuilder) -> AsyncIterator[None]:
    async with asyncpg.create_pool(DATABASE_URL) as pool:
        builder.provide(PG_DB, pool)
        builder.provide(EMBEDDER, SentenceTransformerEmbedder(EMBED_MODEL))

        session = aiobotocore.session.get_session()
        async with session.create_client("s3") as s3_client:
            builder.provide(S3_CLIENT, s3_client)
            yield
```

`create_client("s3")` picks up standard AWS credentials — env vars, `~/.aws/credentials`, or an IAM role. Set `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL` to point at an S3-compatible service like MinIO.

## List objects from the bucket

`app_main` mounts the Postgres table exactly as in the base example, then swaps `localfs.walk_dir` for [`amazon_s3.list_objects`](https://cocoindex.io/docs/connectors/amazon_s3/) — same `path_matcher` glob, same `mount_each` fan-out.

```python title="main.py"
@coco.fn
async def app_main() -> None:
    target_table = await postgres.mount_table_target(
        PG_DB,
        table_name=TABLE_NAME,
        table_schema=await postgres.TableSchema.from_class(
            DocEmbedding, primary_key=["id"],
        ),
        pg_schema_name=PG_SCHEMA_NAME,
    )

    client = coco.use_context(S3_CLIENT)
    files = amazon_s3.list_objects(
        client,
        S3_BUCKET,
        prefix=S3_PREFIX,
        path_matcher=PatternFilePathMatcher(included_patterns=["**/*.md"]),
    )
    await coco.mount_each(process_file, files.items(), target_table)
```

`list_objects` yields one [`S3File`](https://cocoindex.io/docs/connectors/amazon_s3/) per matching object; `prefix` scopes the listing server-side, and the glob filters the rest. `process_file` then reads, chunks, and embeds each one — that code is identical to the base example, so [see it there](https://cocoindex.io/docs/examples/text-embedding/#process-a-file).

## Setup

- A running Postgres with the [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) extension.

  ```sh
  export POSTGRES_URL="postgres://cocoindex:cocoindex@localhost/cocoindex"
  ```

- An S3 bucket with some `.md` files, plus AWS credentials and the bucket name:

  ```sh
  export S3_BUCKET="my-bucket"
  export S3_PREFIX="markdown_files/"   # optional: scope the listing
  ```

- Install CocoIndex with the `amazon_s3` extra and the example's dependencies:

  ```sh
  pip install -U "cocoindex[amazon_s3,postgres,sentence_transformers]" asyncpg pgvector numpy python-dotenv
  ```

## Run the pipeline

The [`amazon_s3` source](https://cocoindex.io/docs/connectors/amazon_s3/) does not support live mode, so this is a one-shot catch-up run — scan the bucket, sync, exit:

```sh
cocoindex update main
```

Then search straight from the command line, reusing the same embedder so indexing and querying stay consistent:

```sh
python main.py "what is self-attention?"
```

The most semantically similar chunks come back ranked — even when they share none of the words in your query.

## Incremental updates

CocoIndex keeps the index in sync with the bucket and does the **minimum work** to get there. `@coco.fn(memo=True)` decides what to *recompute* — a file is skipped when its content and the function's code are both unchanged — and `mount_table_target` decides what to *write*, deriving each row's [`id`](https://cocoindex.io/docs/common_resources/id_generation/) from its chunk text so it upserts only the rows that actually changed and deletes rows whose source object is gone.

- **An object is added** — only that file is chunked and embedded; the rest is untouched.
- **An object is edited** — it is re-chunked; unchanged chunks keep their `id` and embedding, new chunks are embedded and inserted, and stale ones are deleted.
- **An object is deleted** — its rows are removed from the target automatically.

Because S3 is catch-up only, you re-run `cocoindex update main` to pick up bucket changes; the engine still applies just the difference.
