![Image search with ColPali multi-vector embeddings and CocoIndex V1](https://cocoindex.io/blobs/docs-v1/img/examples/image-search-colpali/cover.png)

This is the multi-vector cousin of the [CLIP image search example](https://github.com/cocoindex-io/cocoindex/tree/main/examples/image_search). Same idea — type *"long neck"*, get the giraffe back, no tags or captions — but instead of squeezing each image into a *single* vector, [ColPali](https://huggingface.co/vidore/colpali-v1.2) emits a *bag* of vectors, one per image patch, and matches a query the same way it reads a document: token against patch. The cost is more vectors per image; the payoff is finer-grained retrieval that holds up on dense, text-heavy, or busy images where a single embedding blurs everything together.

The store does the heavy lifting on the query side. We give [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) a **multivector** collection configured for **MaxSim**, so a query's bag of vectors and an image's bag of patch vectors are scored late-interaction style — each query vector finds its best-matching patch, summed across the query. The whole pipeline is ordinary `async` Python and your own types; [incremental processing](https://cocoindex.io/docs/programming_guide/core_concepts/), change tracking, and the managed Qdrant collection run in a Rust engine underneath, in [live mode](https://cocoindex.io/docs/programming_guide/live_mode/) inside the API server, so a new photo in the folder is searchable within a second.

## Flow overview

![CocoIndex ColPali image search indexing flow: walk a folder of images, embed each into a multi-vector bag of patch vectors with ColPali, and declare a point into a Qdrant MaxSim multivector collection](https://cocoindex.io/blobs/docs-v1/img/examples/image-search-colpali/flow-v1.png)

The indexing path is short — there's no text to chunk, just one multi-vector embedding per image:

1. Read image files from a local directory (live).
2. Embed each image with [ColPali](https://huggingface.co/vidore/colpali-v1.2) into a *multi-vector* — a list of 128-d patch vectors, not one fixed vector.
3. Store it in Qdrant (as a [point](https://cocoindex.io/docs/connectors/qdrant/) in a MaxSim multivector collection, keyed by a stable id, with the filename in the payload).

You [declare the transformation logic](https://cocoindex.io/docs/programming_guide/core_concepts/) with native Python, without worrying about how updates propagate. Think: **target_state = transformation(source_state)**.

## Multi-vector embeddings: a bag of vectors per image

This is what sets the example apart from its CLIP sibling. CLIP gives you *one* vector per image; ColPali gives you *many* — a vector per visual patch — and embeds a text query into the same per-token space. Both indexing and querying use the same model, two different entry points: `process_images` for the index side, `process_queries` for the query side.

```python title="pipeline.py"
@functools.cache
def get_colpali() -> tuple[ColPali, ColPaliProcessor, str]:
    model = ColPali.from_pretrained(COLPALI_MODEL_NAME)       # vidore/colpali-v1.2
    processor = ColPaliProcessor.from_pretrained(COLPALI_MODEL_NAME)
    device = get_torch_device("auto")
    model = model.to(device)
    model.eval()
    return model, processor, device


def embed_image_bytes(img_bytes: bytes) -> list[list[float]]:    # indexing side
    model, processor, device = get_colpali()
    image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(img_bytes)).convert("RGB")
    batch = processor.process_images([image]).to(device)
    with torch.no_grad():
        embeddings = model(**batch)
    return _postprocess_embeddings(embeddings, processor)


def embed_query(text: str) -> list[list[float]]:                 # query side
    model, processor, device = get_colpali()
    batch = processor.process_queries(texts=[text]).to(device)
    with torch.no_grad():
        embeddings = model(**batch)
    return _postprocess_embeddings(embeddings, processor)
```

Note the return type: `list[list[float]]`, not `list[float]`. Each image becomes a list of 128-d patch vectors, and each query becomes a list of 128-d token vectors. `_postprocess_embeddings` strips the model's padding so only real patches/tokens survive, and `@functools.cache` loads the (large) ColPali model once and reuses it for every image and every query.

## Setup

- A running [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/):

  ```sh
  docker run -d -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 qdrant/qdrant
  export QDRANT_URL="http://localhost:6334/"
  ```

- Install CocoIndex with the ColPali and Qdrant extras, plus the dependencies this example uses:

  ```sh
  pip install -U "cocoindex[colpali,qdrant]" torch transformers pillow fastapi "uvicorn[standard]" python-dotenv
  ```

- A few images. The example ships an `img/` folder (a cat, a dog, an elephant, a giraffe) — or drop your own `.jpg` / `.png` files in.

## Shared resources: the Qdrant client

The [lifespan](https://cocoindex.io/docs/programming_guide/context/) provides the Qdrant client once at startup, via a [context key](https://cocoindex.io/docs/programming_guide/context/):

```python title="pipeline.py"
QDRANT_DB = coco.ContextKey[QdrantClient]("image_search_colpali")


@coco.lifespan
async def coco_lifespan(builder: coco.EnvironmentBuilder) -> AsyncIterator[None]:
    client = qdrant.create_client(qdrant_url(), prefer_grpc=True)
    builder.provide(QDRANT_DB, client)
    yield
```

## Process an image

![One process_file component per image, fanned out with mount_each: each image is ColPali-embedded into a bag of patch vectors and declared as a Qdrant multivector point](https://cocoindex.io/blobs/docs-v1/img/examples/image-search-colpali/stage-file-process.png)

`process_file` runs once per image: read the bytes, embed with ColPali into a multi-vector, and declare a Qdrant point keyed by a stable id derived from the path, with the filename in the payload. The only difference from the CLIP version is the shape of `embedding` — a list of patch vectors rather than one vector.

```python title="pipeline.py"
@coco.fn(memo=True)
async def process_file(file: FileLike, target: qdrant.CollectionTarget) -> None:
    content = await file.read()
    embedding = embed_image_bytes(content)                  # list[list[float]] — multi-vector
    point = qdrant.PointStruct(
        id=_image_id(file.file_path.path),                  # uuid5 of the path — stable
        vector=embedding,
        payload={"filename": str(file.file_path.path)},
    )
    target.declare_point(point)
```

[`@coco.fn(memo=True)`](https://cocoindex.io/docs/programming_guide/function/) makes it [incremental](https://cocoindex.io/docs/advanced_topics/memoization_keys/): an unchanged image is never re-embedded. Each image runs as its own [processing component](https://cocoindex.io/docs/programming_guide/processing_component/), so the engine tracks them independently — delete an image and its point is removed from Qdrant automatically. `declare_point` declares the point as a [target state](https://cocoindex.io/docs/programming_guide/target_state/); CocoIndex upserts or deletes to match.

## Define the main function

`app_main` mounts the Qdrant collection — this is where the multi-vector setup lives. The vector schema is wrapped in a `MultiVectorSchema`, and the collection is configured with `multivector_comparator="max_sim"` so Qdrant scores points with late interaction. The per-vector dimension comes straight from the model (`model.dim`, 128 for ColPali), then it walks the image folder and mounts one component per file:

```python title="pipeline.py"
@coco.fn
async def app_main(sourcedir: pathlib.Path) -> None:
    model, _, _ = get_colpali()
    dim = int(getattr(model, "dim", 128))   # 128 per patch/token vector

    target_collection = await qdrant.mount_collection_target(
        QDRANT_DB,
        collection_name=QDRANT_COLLECTION,   # "ImageSearchColpali"
        schema=await qdrant.CollectionSchema.create(
            vectors=qdrant.QdrantVectorDef(
                schema=MultiVectorSchema(
                    vector_schema=VectorSchema(dtype=np.dtype(np.float32), size=dim)
                ),
                distance="cosine",
                multivector_comparator="max_sim",   # late-interaction MaxSim
            )
        ),
    )

    files = localfs.walk_dir(
        sourcedir,
        recursive=True,
        path_matcher=PatternFilePathMatcher(
            included_patterns=["**/*.jpg", "**/*.jpeg", "**/*.png"]
        ),
        live=True,   # api.py runs the app with live=True
    )
    await coco.mount_each(process_file, files.items(), target_collection)


app = coco.App(
    coco.AppConfig(name="ImageSearchColpaliV1"),
    app_main,
    sourcedir=pathlib.Path("./img"),
)
```

`mount_collection_target` creates and manages the Qdrant collection for you — multivector schema, idempotent upserts, and cleanup when an image disappears. Because the per-vector size comes from the model, swapping ColPali variants just works.

## Run it as a service

Like the CLIP example, image search runs as a server. `api.py` is a FastAPI app whose [lifespan](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/events/) starts the CocoIndex flow in **live mode** in the background — it blocks startup until the initial sweep finishes (so the collection is queryable), then keeps watching `img/` while it serves requests. There's no separate "build the index" step.

```python title="api.py"
@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI) -> AsyncIterator[None]:
    global _client
    async with coco.runtime():
        _client = qdrant.create_client(pipeline.qdrant_url(), prefer_grpc=True)

        # Start a live update; block until the initial sweep is READY, then run on.
        update_handle = pipeline.app.update(live=True)
        async for snap in update_handle.watch():
            if snap.status is coco.UpdateStatus.READY:
                break
        update_task = asyncio.create_task(update_handle.result())
        try:
            yield
        finally:
            update_task.cancel()


@app.get("/search")
async def search(q: str, limit: int = 5) -> dict:
    query_embedding = pipeline.embed_query(q)               # text → ColPali multi-vector
    results = pipeline._qdrant_search(_client, pipeline.QDRANT_COLLECTION, query_embedding, limit)
    return {"results": [{"filename": (r.payload or {}).get("filename"), "score": r.score} for r in results]}
```

`_qdrant_search` calls Qdrant's `query_points` with the query's *bag* of vectors — Qdrant handles the MaxSim scoring against each point's patch vectors. Start the server, then the frontend:

```sh
python -m uvicorn api:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

cd frontend && npm install && npm run dev   # http://localhost:5173
```

The React app posts your query to `/search`, which embeds the text into ColPali's per-token space and runs a MaxSim search in Qdrant — the match is by *meaning*, patch by patch, never by metadata.

## Incremental updates

Because the flow runs live inside the server, the index tracks the folder with no extra work from you:

- **Add an image** — `process_file` runs once for it, embeds it into a multi-vector, and upserts one Qdrant point. It's searchable within a second.
- **Replace an image** — same id (derived from the path), new bag of vectors; the point is updated in place.
- **Delete an image** — its component disappears and the point is removed from Qdrant.
- **Restart the server** — the initial sweep reconciles against what's already in Qdrant and re-embeds nothing that's unchanged.

Swap the ColPali model and CocoIndex re-embeds everything against the new space; leave it alone and a restart is nearly free.

## Run it

The full, runnable example is in the CocoIndex repo: [examples/image_search_colpali](https://github.com/cocoindex-io/cocoindex/tree/main/examples/image_search_colpali). For the lighter, single-vector version that fits more images in memory and indexes faster, see the [CLIP image search example](https://github.com/cocoindex-io/cocoindex/tree/main/examples/image_search); for the text equivalent, see [Semantic Search 101](https://cocoindex.io/docs/examples/text-embedding/).
