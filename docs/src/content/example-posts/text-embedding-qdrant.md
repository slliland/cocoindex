![Semantic Search with Qdrant on CocoIndex V1](https://cocoindex.io/blobs/docs-v1/img/examples/text-embedding-qdrant/cover.png)

This is the [Semantic Search 101](https://cocoindex.io/docs/examples/text-embedding/) example with one thing swapped: instead of Postgres + pgvector, the vectors land in a [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) collection. Everything else — walk Markdown, chunk, embed locally with `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` — is identical, so this post stays short and spends its words on the connector, the collection setup, and how to run it.

If you want the full chunk-and-embed walkthrough, read the [base example](https://cocoindex.io/docs/examples/text-embedding/) first; the only difference here is the target.

## Flow overview

![CocoIndex text embedding flow with Qdrant: read Markdown, split into chunks, embed each chunk, and upsert the vectors into a Qdrant collection](https://cocoindex.io/blobs/docs-v1/img/examples/text-embedding-qdrant/flow-v1.png)

From a high level, these are the steps:

1. Read Markdown files from a local directory.
2. [Split each file into overlapping chunks](https://cocoindex.io/docs/ops/text/), then [embed](https://cocoindex.io/docs/ops/sentence_transformers/) every chunk.
3. Upsert each chunk's embedding (with its text and metadata) as a point in a [Qdrant](https://cocoindex.io/docs/connectors/qdrant/) collection (as [target states](https://cocoindex.io/docs/programming_guide/target_state/)).

You [declare the transformation logic](https://cocoindex.io/docs/programming_guide/core_concepts/) with native Python, without worrying about how updates propagate. Think: **target_state = transformation(source_state)**.

## Setup

- A running Qdrant. The local container exposes HTTP on `6333` and gRPC on `6334`:

  ```sh
  docker run -d -p 6333:6333 -p 6334:6334 qdrant/qdrant
  ```

- Install CocoIndex and the dependencies this example uses:

  ```sh
  pip install -U "cocoindex[qdrant,sentence_transformers]" qdrant-client numpy python-dotenv
  ```

- A few `.md` files to index. Grab the [sample file](https://github.com/cocoindex-io/cocoindex/tree/main/examples/text_embedding_qdrant/markdown_files) from the repo, or drop your own notes into a `markdown_files/` directory.

## Connect to Qdrant

The Qdrant client is a [shared resource](https://cocoindex.io/docs/programming_guide/context/): provide it once in the [lifespan](https://cocoindex.io/docs/programming_guide/app/) and every step reuses it. We connect over gRPC (`prefer_grpc=True`) for fast point upserts, and provide the same embedder the base example uses.

```python title="main.py"
QDRANT_URL = "http://localhost:6334"
QDRANT_COLLECTION = "TextEmbedding"
EMBED_MODEL = "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"

QDRANT_DB = coco.ContextKey[QdrantClient]("text_embedding_qdrant")
EMBEDDER = coco.ContextKey[SentenceTransformerEmbedder]("embedder", detect_change=True)


@coco.lifespan
async def coco_lifespan(builder: coco.EnvironmentBuilder) -> AsyncIterator[None]:
    client = qdrant.create_client(QDRANT_URL, prefer_grpc=True)
    builder.provide(QDRANT_DB, client)
    builder.provide(EMBEDDER, SentenceTransformerEmbedder(EMBED_MODEL))
    yield
```

## Mount the collection

`app_main` wires the source to the target. The one Qdrant-specific call is [`mount_collection_target`](https://cocoindex.io/docs/connectors/qdrant/): it creates and manages the collection, deriving the vector dimensions straight from the embedder via `QdrantVectorDef(schema=EMBEDDER)` — no hardcoded `384`. The rest is the same `walk_dir` → `mount_each` shape as the base example.

```python title="main.py"
@coco.fn
async def app_main(sourcedir: pathlib.Path) -> None:
    target_collection = await qdrant.mount_collection_target(
        QDRANT_DB,
        collection_name=QDRANT_COLLECTION,
        schema=await qdrant.CollectionSchema.create(
            vectors=qdrant.QdrantVectorDef(schema=EMBEDDER)
        ),
    )
    files = localfs.walk_dir(
        sourcedir,
        recursive=True,
        path_matcher=PatternFilePathMatcher(included_patterns=["**/*.md"]),
        live=True,  # watch for changes; pass -L to `cocoindex update` to run live
    )
    await coco.mount_each(process_file, files.items(), target_collection)
```

`mount_collection_target` handles collection creation, idempotent point upserts, and orphan cleanup when a file disappears — the same managed-target guarantees pgvector gets in the base example.

## Declare a point

`process_file` chunks the text and maps each chunk to `process_chunk` (identical to the base walkthrough). The only difference is the target state: instead of a typed table row, each chunk becomes a Qdrant [`PointStruct`](https://cocoindex.io/docs/connectors/qdrant/). The chunk text and offsets go in the `payload`, the embedding is the `vector`, and `id_gen` derives a stable point id from the chunk text so re-runs upsert in place.

```python title="main.py"
@coco.fn
async def process_chunk(
    chunk: Chunk,
    filename: pathlib.PurePath,
    id_gen: IdGenerator,
    target: qdrant.CollectionTarget,
) -> None:
    embedding_vec = await coco.use_context(EMBEDDER).embed(chunk.text)

    point = qdrant.PointStruct(
        id=await id_gen.next_id(chunk.text),
        vector=embedding_vec.tolist(),
        payload={
            "filename": str(filename),
            "chunk_start": chunk.start.char_offset,
            "chunk_end": chunk.end.char_offset,
            "text": chunk.text,
        },
    )
    target.declare_point(point)
```

`target.declare_point` declares the point as a target state; CocoIndex inserts, updates, or deletes it to match — you never write upsert calls yourself.

## Run the pipeline

Run the [`cocoindex` CLI](https://cocoindex.io/docs/cli/) to build and update the index. Choose catch-up (scan, sync, exit) or live (catch up, then keep watching):

```sh
# Catch-up run
cocoindex update main

# Live run: keep watching for file changes
cocoindex update -L main
```

Then run a search from the command line — it embeds your query with the *same* model and asks Qdrant for the nearest points:

```bash
python main.py "what is self-attention?"
```

You can also browse the collection in the Qdrant dashboard at <http://localhost:6333/dashboard>.

## Incremental updates

CocoIndex keeps the Qdrant collection in sync and does the **minimum work** to get there — exactly as in the [base example](https://cocoindex.io/docs/examples/text-embedding/), just against Qdrant. `@coco.fn(memo=True)` on `process_file` decides what to *recompute* (a file is skipped when its content and code are unchanged), and each point's [`id`](https://cocoindex.io/docs/common_resources/id_generation/) is derived from its chunk's text, so `mount_collection_target` upserts only the points that changed and deletes points whose source is gone. Add a file and only it is embedded; edit one and unchanged chunks keep their id while new chunks are upserted and vanished chunks deleted; delete a file and its points are removed automatically. Swap the embedding model and `detect_change=True` re-embeds everything. A catch-up run applies the difference once and exits; live mode keeps watching.

## Run it

The full, runnable example is in the CocoIndex repo: [examples/text_embedding_qdrant](https://github.com/cocoindex-io/cocoindex/tree/main/examples/text_embedding_qdrant). It's the [Semantic Search 101](https://cocoindex.io/docs/examples/text-embedding/) flow with Qdrant as the store — start there if you want the chunk-and-embed details, and see [the Postgres version](https://cocoindex.io/docs/examples/text-embedding/) to compare targets.
