![CSV in, Kafka out — row by row, live, with CocoIndex](https://cocoindex.io/blobs/docs-v1/img/examples/csv-to-kafka/cover.png)

We'll take a folder of CSV files and turn it into a live [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) stream — each row published as a JSON message, keyed by its primary key. Edit a cell and, within a second, exactly one message for that one row lands on the topic. Add a row, get one new message. Delete a file, and every row from it is tombstoned.

The whole pipeline is ordinary `async` Python, and the Kafka topic is just a [target](https://cocoindex.io/docs/connectors/kafka/) you declare — the same way you'd declare a Postgres table or a vector index. CocoIndex's Rust engine does the [incremental processing](https://cocoindex.io/docs/programming_guide/core_concepts/) underneath: it tracks what each row last looked like and produces a message only for rows that *actually changed* — no producer loop, no dedup bookkeeping, no "did I already send this?" logic.

## Flow overview

![CocoIndex CSV → Kafka flow: watch a folder of CSV files, run one process_csv component per file that turns each row into a JSON message, and declare it as a Kafka topic target state](https://cocoindex.io/blobs/docs-v1/img/examples/csv-to-kafka/flow-v1.png)

From a high level, these are the steps:

1. Watch a local directory of CSV files (live).
2. For each file, parse rows with `csv.DictReader` and turn each row into a JSON value keyed by its first column.
3. Declare each row as a [target state](https://cocoindex.io/docs/programming_guide/target_state/) on a Kafka topic — CocoIndex produces the upserts and deletes.

You [declare the transformation logic](https://cocoindex.io/docs/programming_guide/core_concepts/) with native Python, without worrying about how updates propagate. Think: **target_state = transformation(source_state)**.

> **Why CSV?** It's the format that shows up everywhere and gets respect nowhere — BI exports, vendor dumps, spreadsheets parked in a shared drive. CSV files look structured but live like unstructured assets: dropped into a folder, edited at random, with no notifications and no schema contract. Turning a directory of them into a clean, row-keyed, diff-only Kafka stream is the same pattern that carries over to PDFs, codebases, and wikis — CSV just keeps the parser out of the way.

## Setup

- A running Kafka broker. Any broker the [`confluent_kafka`](https://github.com/confluentinc/confluent-kafka-python) client can reach works — a local `localhost:9092`, or a managed one like [StreamNative](https://streamnative.io/) with SASL. If you don't have one, a single-container [Redpanda](https://redpanda.com/) (Kafka-API compatible) is the quickest local broker:

  ```sh
  docker run -d --name redpanda -p 9092:9092 redpandadata/redpanda:latest \
    redpanda start --mode dev-container --smp 1 \
    --kafka-addr PLAINTEXT://0.0.0.0:9092 --advertise-kafka-addr PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092

  # CocoIndex never creates topics — create the one it produces into:
  docker exec redpanda rpk topic create cocoindex-csv-rows
  ```

- Install CocoIndex with the Kafka extra:

  ```sh
  pip install -U "cocoindex[kafka]"
  ```

- A `data/` folder with a couple of CSV files. The example ships these:

  ```csv
  # data/products.csv
  sku,name,category,price
  SKU001,Wireless Mouse,Electronics,29.99
  SKU002,Mechanical Keyboard,Electronics,89.99
  SKU003,USB-C Hub,Accessories,45.00
  ```

  The first column (`sku`) is the row's primary key — it becomes the Kafka message key.

## Shared resources: the Kafka producer

The Kafka producer is created once at app startup in a [`lifespan`](https://cocoindex.io/docs/programming_guide/context/) hook and stashed in a [`ContextKey`](https://cocoindex.io/docs/programming_guide/context/), so the rest of the pipeline can grab it without threading it through every call:

```python title="main.py"
import cocoindex as coco
from cocoindex.connectors import kafka, localfs
from confluent_kafka.aio import AIOProducer

KAFKA_PRODUCER = coco.ContextKey[AIOProducer]("kafka_producer")


@coco.lifespan
async def coco_lifespan(builder: coco.EnvironmentBuilder) -> AsyncIterator[None]:
    config: dict[str, str] = {"bootstrap.servers": KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS}
    if KAFKA_SASL_USERNAME:
        config.update({
            "sasl.mechanism": "PLAIN",
            "security.protocol": "SASL_SSL",
            "sasl.username": KAFKA_SASL_USERNAME,
            "sasl.password": KAFKA_SASL_PASSWORD,
        })
    producer = AIOProducer(config)
    builder.provide(KAFKA_PRODUCER, producer)
    yield
```

The SASL block is what a managed broker (StreamNative or similar) wants. For a local broker you can drop it and just point `bootstrap.servers` at `localhost:9092`. The `ContextKey` also does double duty later: CocoIndex's state store identifies the topic by *which key the producer was anchored to* plus the topic name — so rotating the SASL password or swapping the broker endpoint doesn't make it re-broadcast every row.

## Process a file

![One process_csv component per CSV file, fanned out with mount_each: each file's rows become (key, value) target states on the Kafka topic](https://cocoindex.io/blobs/docs-v1/img/examples/csv-to-kafka/stage-process-csv.png)

`process_csv` runs once per file. It reads the text, parses rows with `csv.DictReader` (the header row becomes the keys), and declares each row as a target state — key from the first column, value the JSON-encoded row:

```python title="main.py"
@coco.fn(memo=True)
async def process_csv(file: FileLike, topic_target: kafka.KafkaTopicTarget) -> None:
    text = await file.read_text()
    reader = csv.DictReader(io.StringIO(text))

    headers = reader.fieldnames
    if not headers:
        return
    first_col = headers[0]

    for row in reader:
        key_value = row.get(first_col)
        if key_value is not None:
            value = json.dumps(row)
            topic_target.declare_target_state(key=key_value, value=value)
```

[`@coco.fn(memo=True)`](https://cocoindex.io/docs/programming_guide/function/) makes the per-file work [incremental](https://cocoindex.io/docs/advanced_topics/memoization_keys/): if a file's contents and this function's code are both unchanged, `process_csv` doesn't even run. Each file runs as its own [processing component](https://cocoindex.io/docs/programming_guide/processing_component/) (mounted below), so the engine tracks each file's rows independently — and when a file disappears, its rows are cleaned off the topic automatically.

## Declare states, not messages

The one line worth pausing on is `declare_target_state` — deliberately *not* `send_message()` or `produce()`.

```python
topic_target.declare_target_state(key=key, value=value)
```

CocoIndex is [state-driven](https://cocoindex.io/docs/programming_guide/core_concepts/): like a spreadsheet cell or a SQL materialized view, you describe what the target *should be* as a function of the source, and the engine figures out the transitions. You don't compute deltas, and you don't write separate insert / update / delete code paths.

![Declared target states above the line and the Kafka messages they produce below: editing one CSV cell, adding a row, and removing a row yield exactly the upsert and delete messages needed — the unchanged row produces nothing](https://cocoindex.io/blobs/docs-v1/img/examples/csv-to-kafka/state-vs-messages.svg)

Kafka makes this vivid because its wire model is the opposite of state: a topic is a *log of events*, not a snapshot. CocoIndex owns the gap. When you call `declare_target_state(key=k, value=v)`:

- **`k` is new, or `v` changed** → it produces an **upsert** message `(k, v)`.
- **`k` was declared before but isn't this time** → it produces a **delete** message `(k, None)` (or a tombstone if you supplied a `deletion_value_fn`).
- **`k` was declared with the same `v`** → **nothing is sent.** No message, no broker round-trip, no consumer wakeup.

Messages are derived from state transitions; you only ever talk about states. It's the same shape as the [Postgres target](https://cocoindex.io/docs/connectors/postgres/) (`declare_target_state` → INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE) — the wire ops differ, the API doesn't, because the semantics are the same. The payoff: one `process_csv` is correct on the first run, every subsequent run, and after a crash-restart — there's no separate "initial load" versus "incremental update" path.

## Define the main function

`app_main` wires the source to the target. It mounts the Kafka topic, walks `./data` for CSV files as a live source, and mounts one component per file:

```python title="main.py"
@coco.fn
async def app_main() -> None:
    topic_target = await kafka.mount_kafka_topic_target(KAFKA_PRODUCER, KAFKA_TOPIC)

    files = localfs.walk_dir(
        localfs.FilePath(path="./data"),
        path_matcher=PatternFilePathMatcher(included_patterns=["**/*.csv"]),
        live=True,  # watch for changes; pass -L to `cocoindex update` to run live
    )
    await coco.mount_each(process_csv, files.items(), topic_target)


app = coco.App(coco.AppConfig(name="CsvToKafka"), app_main)
```

Two things to notice:

1. `mount_kafka_topic_target(...)` resolves the producer from the context key and hands back a target handle. The topic itself is **user-managed** — CocoIndex never creates or deletes topics, it just produces into one you already own.
2. `localfs.walk_dir(..., live=True)` makes the [filesystem source](https://cocoindex.io/docs/connectors/localfs/) a [live source](https://cocoindex.io/docs/programming_guide/live_mode/): it scans once, then keeps watching `./data` (via [`watchfiles`](https://github.com/samuelcolvin/watchfiles)) and pushes incremental updates downstream. [`mount_each`](https://cocoindex.io/docs/programming_guide/app/) runs one `process_csv` component per file.

That's the whole pipeline — one file, ~60 lines.

## Run the pipeline

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your Kafka bootstrap (and SASL creds if your broker needs them), then run the [`cocoindex` CLI](https://cocoindex.io/docs/cli/). Choose catch-up (scan, sync, exit) or live (catch up, then keep watching):

```sh
# Catch-up run: reconcile the topic up to now, then exit
cocoindex update main.py

# Live run: catch up, then keep watching ./data and produce on every change
cocoindex update -L main.py
```

Live mode is **one keyword argument and one flag** different from catch-up — `live=True` on `walk_dir`, and `-L` on the CLI. `process_csv` and the Kafka target don't change: reconciliation logic is identical, the flag only controls whether the app scans once and exits or keeps watching. There's no separate "streaming" code path to maintain.

## Looking at the topic

Here's the `cocoindex-csv-rows` topic after a run, in StreamNative's hosted console (any Kafka consumer shows the same thing):

![Messages on the Kafka topic after running the CSV → Kafka pipeline: keys are the row primary keys (SKU001, SKU002, …) and values are the JSON-encoded rows](https://cocoindex.io/blobs/docs-v1/img/examples/csv-to-kafka/streamnative-topic.png)

Keys are the row's first column (`SKU001`, `SKU002`, …); values are the JSON-encoded rows. Edit a CSV locally and a new message with the *same key* appears — so log-compacted topics and key-based consumers always see the current state. Each key hashes to a partition via Kafka's default partitioner, exactly as it would with a hand-rolled producer.

## Incremental updates

This is where the declarative model pays for itself. You never compute a diff or write produce logic — change something, and CocoIndex works out the minimum set of messages to bring the topic in line. It keeps an [internal state store](https://cocoindex.io/docs/advanced_topics/internal_storage/) remembering the last value sent for every key, and that store survives restarts, so stopping and restarting never re-broadcasts unchanged rows.

- **Edit one cell** — exactly one upsert message, for that one row. Every other row is silent.
- **Add a row** — one new upsert message.
- **Delete a row** — one delete message for its key.
- **Add a CSV file** — `process_csv` runs once for it and publishes its rows.
- **Delete a CSV file** — every row from it gets a delete message.
- **Nothing changed** — a re-run produces zero messages.

A catch-up run (`cocoindex update main.py`) does this once and exits; live mode (`cocoindex update -L main.py`) keeps watching and applies each change with sub-second latency.

## Run it

The full, runnable example is in the CocoIndex repo: [examples/csv_to_kafka](https://github.com/cocoindex-io/cocoindex/tree/main/examples/csv_to_kafka). The natural next step is the consumer side — [kafka_to_lancedb](https://github.com/cocoindex-io/cocoindex/tree/main/examples/kafka_to_lancedb) reads JSON messages off a topic and dispatches them into LanceDB tables, so the same declarative flow that *produces* changes can *consume* them too.
