//! First-class SDK operations: text splitting, embedding, and transcription.
//!
//! Mirrors Python's `cocoindex.ops` package. Each submodule is gated behind a
//! feature so the heavy dependencies (tree-sitter grammars, ONNX runtime,
//! HTTP) are only pulled in when used:
//!
//! - [`text`] (`text` feature): language detection and recursive/separator
//!   chunking.
//! - [`sentence_transformers`] (`fastembed` feature): local sentence-transformer
//!   embeddings.
//! - [`image`] (`fastembed` feature): local image (CLIP) embeddings.
//! - [`api`] (`embed_api` feature): remote embeddings/transcription over an
//!   OpenAI-compatible HTTP API.
